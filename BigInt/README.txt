  BigInt Test Suite - Operator Overloaded Version

===============================================================================
NOTES:

This is a test suite for an operator overloaded BigInt type.

There is a driver.cpp file provided in the directory with the test
programs.  It can be copied into the development directory and
added to.  There is a rule in the makefile to compile the driver.

Regression testing is provided.  For example target t3 will also
do t2 and t1.

To compile and have make ignore errors use the options "-ik", ex.

    make -ik t6

Tests will be added if it is discovered more tests need to be done.

===============================================================================
DEVELOPMENT:

Some tests depend on more functionality than others, thus when
developing implement the functions in the order that tests are
numbered in the Makefile.

Type "make" and the make file will show valid targets.
